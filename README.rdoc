== Music Blog App

I decided to build a simple app that will allow me to easily share music with everyone instead of having to send links through e-mail, chat, Facebook, etc. 

Some Features:

* Core config data is in config.yml file

* Use of [will_paginate](http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate) gem for post pagination

* [Omniauth](http://github.com/intridea/omniauth) used for admin authentication with Twitter login

* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework used for front-end

* [Cancan](http://github.com/ryanb/cancan) used for admin authorization

* [Embedly](http://www.embed.ly) API for easily embedding media players 

* Use of [simple_form](http://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) gem to easily create new post forms
